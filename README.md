# Pig Game 🎲

This Pig Game (also known as Ludo) is a simple dice game where two players take turns to roll a dice and accumulate scores. The project was developed as a part of the JavaScript Bootcamp course guided by Jonas Schemdtmann. It demonstrates the concepts of DOM Manipulation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In the Pig Game, two players compete to reach a total score of 100. The player whose side is highlighted with a whitish background is the active player. The game follows the following rules:

- Each player takes turns rolling the dice to accumulate scores.
- The current score is displayed as the dice roll adds up.
- If a player rolls a 1 on the dice, their turn ends, and the other player becomes active.
- The 'Hold' button allows the active player to transfer their current score to the total score and switch to the other player.
- The game continues until one player reaches a total score of 100 or more.
- The winning player's card will turn black, indicating their victory.
- Pressing the 'New Game' button refreshes the game and starts a new round.
